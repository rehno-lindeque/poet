Poet is a small templating language intended to generate html and other text formats. 
It is also a first basic prototype for the upcoming LangLang programming language.

Poet is currently in an alpha phase and cannot yet be used for much that's usefull.

I've released Poet under a GPL ver 3 while it's int its incubation phase.
In future I intend to relicense the code under a more permissive license such as BSD or MIT.
If you wish to contribute to the project please contact me at rehno.lindeque (adding @gmail.com to the end).

Regards,
Rehno Lindeque
